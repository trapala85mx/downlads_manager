Script to manage my downlaods folder

This is a personal use scritp to manage my files in the Downloads folder in my system by moving to the specific type folder to, later, i check them and select if the file stays or is reasigned.

For now, is to keep my Downloads folder clean. In some updates i will set a specific way to name the files so they will be moved to specific folders in my system and keep my computer in order.

## Requirements
- Python 3.13

Optional: I'm using "uv" for managing virtual environment.
